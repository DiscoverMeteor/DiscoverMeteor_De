### A couple of english terms to stick with - even in german:

- Package
- Repository
- Code
- Framework

In german, we have two meanings of the word 'YOU' - the one complies (approx.) with the historic-english 'thou' and is used with friends and family, the other is used (more or less) when communicating to strangers (or people outside the former 'friends and family' group).
For this book, I decided to use the 'friends/familiy' variation, which translates to 'Du'. So the author talks to the reader directly, which I find more appropriate for this kind of *geeky* material ;)
